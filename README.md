Halite Game Manager
-------------------
This is a small Python script which runs multiple games of Halite for easier testing.

It is not intended to be secure: bot names in particular could be used for SQL injecttions. This is fine for its intended use (local testing, no networking), but would become a problem if it were used as a backend for a web-connected service. You have been warned.

It is incomplete but functional. More work to follow.
